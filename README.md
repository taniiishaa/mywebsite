## üí° The Challenge: Unlocking Tribal Empowerment

The **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006**, is a cornerstone of social justice, yet its effective implementation is often hindered by legacy data issues, manual processes, and a lack of spatial integration. This results in:

1.  **Non-Standardized Records:** Claims and titles exist largely as dispersed, paper-based documents.
2.  **Missing Spatial Intelligence:** Difficulties in accurately mapping recognized rights (IFR, CR, CFR) and reconciling them with forest boundaries.
3.  **Ineffective Scheme Integration:** Inability to seamlessly layer development schemes (PM-KISAN, MGNREGA) onto FRA land assets, limiting tribal community benefits.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: Root2Rise

**Root2Rise** is a comprehensive, centralized digital platform‚Äîa **Government of India Initiative** concept‚Äîthat utilizes next-generation technology to accelerate and optimize the implementation of the FRA.

We deliver a dynamic **Decision Support System (DSS)** built on an interactive **WebGIS** framework and powered by **Artificial Intelligence**.

### Key Technology Drivers

| Component | Technology | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Extraction** | **AI-Powered Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Automates the digitization and standardization of millions of paper-based FRA records. |
| **Core Platform** | **WebGIS (Leaflet.js) / PostGIS** | Centralized, spatial visualization of all FRA claims and land assets. |
| **Resource Mapping** | **Satellite Remote Sensing & Computer Vision** | Identifies, maps, and monitors natural and infrastructural assets (water bodies, agriculture, forest cover) within FRA areas. |
| **Policy Engine** | **Decision Support System (DSS)** | Provides data-driven recommendations for scheme layering and resource allocation. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Modules

### 1. Interactive FRA Atlas (WebGIS)
Visualize the entire lifecycle of forest rights across the nation. The atlas allows officials to:
* View boundaries for **Individual Forest Rights (IFR)**, **Community Rights (CR)**, and **Community Forest Resource (CFR)** titles.
* Overlay satellite-derived asset maps to verify land use and monitor change over time.
* Track real-time implementation metrics (titles granted, claims pending) spatially.
* **Focus States:** Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, and Telangana.

### 2. Decision Support System (DSS)
The DSS is the intelligence layer of Root2Rise. It automatically:
* **Identifies Eligible Beneficiaries:** Cross-references land titles and spatial assets with the criteria of key development schemes (e.g., Jal Jeevan Mission suitability based on water body proximity mapped by satellite).
* **Generates Actionable Insights:** Recommends optimal locations for government interventions (e.g., MGNREGA projects) to enhance community assets.
* **Provides Analytics:** Supplies high-level dashboards for ministry officials to gauge implementation efficiency and regional disparities.
